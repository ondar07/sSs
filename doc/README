==================================================


HOW IT WORKS

1) This server uses Linux's epoll facility, which is readiness notification facility in Linux (epoll was introduced in Linux 2.6, so you should be sure that you have suitable Linux version)

Why epoll?
select() monitors a fixed number of descriptors. poll() doesn't have a fixed limit, but it performs a linear scan of all descriptors every time to check readiness notification ( complexity - O(n) )

epoll() doesn't have such disadvantages. Moreover, it can handle a larger number of events.


===================================================


FEATURES

1) epoll

2) support a wide range of mime types

3) support indexes (in the terms of Apache)

4) support detecting of mime-type
Dut to supporting the database (sqlite3) with pathes for icons, the web server is able to detect correct file type icon path
